      With Gratitude, is a participatory project designed to inspire deeper reflection on the people we cherish. Participants are invited to draw a portrait and write a note to or about someone they’re grateful for. These submissions are collected and shared on this site, creating a space where anyone can explore and connect with others’ expressions of gratitude.

      This project seeks to nurture a community of thankfulness, recognizing that many of us struggle to express gratitude or live with regrets about unspoken appreciation for those who are no longer in our lives. Through this shared archive of gratitude, I hope to encourage more openness, reflection, and connection.
